# Differentially Private Synthetic Data Generation Using Normalizing Flows

This repository contains the code and scripts to train models that generate differentially private synthetic data from original datasets containing confidential and/or sensitive data. The model is based on the Masked Autoregressive Flows (MAF) architecture and Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD). The code is implemented in Pytorch and uses the [Opacus](https://opacus.ai/) library for Differential Privacy.

### System Requirements

### How to run the code

Each of the scripts contain various options to run the code. Please run `python <script>.py --help` to see all the options before running the code.
