# Differentially Private Synthetic Data Generation Using Normalizing Flows

This repository contains the code and scripts to train models that generate differentially private synthetic data from original datasets containing confidential and/or sensitive data. The model is based on the Masked Autoregressive Flows (MAF) architecture and Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent. The code is implemented in Pytorch and uses the Opacus library for Differential Privacy
