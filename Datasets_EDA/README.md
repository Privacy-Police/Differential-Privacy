Each folder contains IPyhton Notebook that explores the data through visualizations and data distribution. 

The `data` subfolder contains the raw and cleaned versions for the datasets. 

The cleaned datasets only contain continuous variables for MAF model fitting, synthetic data generation and analysis. We have also removed rows that contained null values in any column in their raw form.
